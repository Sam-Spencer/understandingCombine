Now that we've talked about subscribers, we can turn to publishers. The Combine framework provides quite a few built-in publishers. I divide these into several types. I'll start with what I call _Foundation_ publishers. These are publishers that are tacked on to various existing Foundation facilities that you've probably been using already to receive asynchronous signals. Thanks to these publishers, you can easily adapt your existing code to use the Combine framework instead.
