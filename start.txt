The Combine framework was introduced by Apple in iOS 13 in Xcode 11 along with Swift 5.1. What is it, why would you want to use it, and how do you use it? That's what this little book will explain.

There are lots of tutorials about the Combine framework, and there's no particular reason why another one is needed. However, in studying the Combine framework for my own use, I've arrived at my own way of understanding it and explaining it to myself, so perhaps the results of my investigations and my approach to thinking about Combine will be useful to others as well.
