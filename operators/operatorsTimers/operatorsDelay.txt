# <%= title %>

`.delay` (Publishers.Delay) inserts a pause between the time a value is received from upstream and the time it is passed on downstream. The parameters are:

`for:`
: The length of the delay. You can write an expression such as `.seconds(1)`, `.milliseconds(100)`, and so forth; if you supply an Int or Double literal, it will be taken to mean seconds.

`tolerance:`
: The permitted tolerance. It has the same type as `for:`. Optional; you'll usually omit it.

`scheduler:`
: The queue or runloop on which the delay will be measured. You'll supply a DispatchQueue, an OperationQueue, or a RunLoop; the usual value is `DispatchQueue.main`.

`options:`
: Optional. You'll usually omit it.
